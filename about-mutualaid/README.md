# About MutualAid

We hope folks are staying safe and sane in the midst of this crisis. We’re so grateful to all the talented, passionate people who have jumped into this project with us. We are all volunteers with an interest in helping others, and this is an open-source initiative. Our hope is the project can be largely non-hierarchical and self-managing. For those who aren’t used to it, this kind of grassroots crisis-response project can feel a bit chaotic, so we want to make sure folks have a few key points of contact that understand the plan and can help coordinate the work across different areas. They form a bridge between and within different teams and help ensure we stay on course. To this end, we have organized into a few workstreams, with a few key folks within each. If we’ve missed your name from a key role you are already playing below, we sincerely apologize. Things have been moving fast and it’s hard to get a consistent view all in one place. That said please don’t hesitate to let us know so we can fix it for next time! You are all valued.

## **Data Science**

The data science team supports both the Resilience app and SafeTrace API.  Data science team members can be found advising on database schema, performing analysis of data, or solving specific problems \(such as providing a traveling salesman algorithm for mission assignments\).  For those interested in working on developing matching algorithms between volunteers and requesters then focusing on the Resilience app is recommended. For those interested in aiding in predicting outbreak risk, then SafeTrace API is recommended.
