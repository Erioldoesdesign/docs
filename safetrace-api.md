# SafeTrace API

**Goal:** SafeTraceAPI is about privacy-enabled contact tracing. We’re trying to build a real-world app as fast as possible but we’re focused on building an API that preserves privacy and can be integrated with other contact tracing apps. SafeTraceAPI is also working on some next level cryptography using multiparty computation and other techniques to strongly preserve the privacy of you or your organization's data while still being able to use it to calculate things like contact tracing in a ‘shared computation’ with other parties. Some interesting white papers and great code are the outputs here.
