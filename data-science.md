# Data Science

**Goal:** The data science team supports both the Resilience app and SafeTrace API.  Data science team members can be found advising on database schema, performing analysis of data, or solving specific problems \(such as providing a traveling salesman algorithm for mission assignments\).  For those interested in working on developing matching algorithms between volunteers and requesters then focusing on the Resilience app is recommended. For those interested in aiding in predicting outbreak risk, then SafeTrace API is recommended.
