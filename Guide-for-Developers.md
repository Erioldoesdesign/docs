Remember, we’re just a group of people volunteering and self-organizing. Leave notes, ask questions, and know that any work at all is appreciated. :-)

# First. You need access.
<b>Developer Tasks</b> are here: [Resilience App - AirTable](https://airtable.com/tblRjd2McKgRW9MKj/viwlRRNI0PZIxrGkc?blocks=hide)
 * Anyone can view. To pick up a task, get added as an editor by asking @beth, @Erika_Margaret, @Miles, @Terrance @Joshkurzich or @Tuan 

<b>Development Work</b> happens here: [Resilience App - GitHub](https://github.com/factn/resilience-app)
* Read through the documentation in the homepage README and [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/factn/resilience-app/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to learn how to work with us
*Check out the working [demo](https://mutualaidworld-frontend.herokuapp.com/) of the app
# Second. Check out the process.
<b>For new developer:</b>
* Please checkout github issues and if you do not have access to assign yourself to it just yet, just write a comment in the github issue, and then contact @miles to get access.

<b>Grab a Task</b> in AirTable
* On top left, go to “Stories” tab and switch between <b>Dev Kanban</b> and <b>Story Refinement</b>
* Under <b></b> Dev Kanban, you'll find a column called <b>Backlog</b>
*Pick out a task from there, note if it’s for <b>skateboard</b>, <b>scooter</b>, or <b>bicycle</b>, assign it to yourself, and move the card to <b>In Progress</b> status  (Huh? [Skateboard, Scooter, Bicycle](https://blog.crisp.se/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Making-sense-of-MVP-.jpg))
* Once the task is developed, create a Pull Request in GitHub, go back to the card in AirTable to add a link to the pull request, then slide that card over to <b>Code Review</b>

<b>Questions</b> about work
* Post questions in Slack! You have great resources in the following channels:
   * #resilience-app
   * #resilience-design
   * #project-management

<b>Approvals</b> for work
* <b>Skateboard</b> and <b>scooter stages</b>: Connect with the Collaborators on your task, and if you need more approval than that, throw something in slack.
* <b>Bicycle</b> stage: @Linc is the product owner for sign-off.
