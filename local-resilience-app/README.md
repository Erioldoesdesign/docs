# Local Resilience App

**Goal**: To build a compelling app for local resilience. We are building a strong feedback loop from on-the-ground community organizers and UX/design teams in order to fully capture and prioritize user stories for our app. In the meantime we are building our version 2 app based on what we already know. We want to architect and develop a scalable product to meet the needs of local communities in the short, medium, and post-pandemic long-term. This is a multi-team effort involving copywriting, design/UX, front/back-end development, and data science.

#### Landing-Page Team

The Landing Page team's goal is to create a "public-facing" website for Resilience \(and sibling projects\) to use for Recruiting volunteers to aid in the development of Resilience \(and sibling projects\). Creating an inviting, refined \(but not corporate\) online presence to entice various mutual aid organizations to use Resilience in order to expand their community outreach programs. Celebrating our project volunteers which in turn provides them a method of building clout in their respective occupational fields and demonstrating their expertise outside of the Resilience project. Showcasing case studies—providing "receipts"—of organizations who utilize Resilience which in turn will build project credibility.
