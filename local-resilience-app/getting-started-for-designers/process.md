# Process and Workflow

{% hint style="danger" %}
Wait! If you haven't yet, view the [Figma Onboarding Doc](https://www.figma.com/file/v5HdxDsvO2NzMuZU6CArzF/Resilience-App?node-id=1257%3A553)!
{% endhint %}

### **Grab a Task on** [**AirTable**](https://airtable.com/tblRjd2McKgRW9MKj/viwAsqEsBiGxnqy7H?blocks=hide)\*\*\*\*

Make sure you're on the **Stories** and **Design** view

![AirTable screenshot of tabs](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%283%29.png)

Under **Design,** you’ll find a column called **Lo-Fi Design Please.**

Pick out a task from there, note if it’s for MVP.0, MVP.1, etc. \(As of April 15, 2020, we are working on releasing MVP.0\).

**Drag** that story over to the **Design Underway** column and add your name to the **Designer** field**.**

Once the task is designed in Figma, go back to AirTable and slide that block over to the **Lo-Fi Design Ready** column and make sure to link the frame in Figma in the notes section of the AirTable user story card.

In the [\#resilience-app](https://mutualaidworld.slack.com/archives/C010VC3EN2G) Slack channel, let everyone know you have finished the design for ‘X’ card,  include a link to the AirTable user story card and the Figma link \(and prototype link if available\).

If there is nothing to do in the **Lo-Fi Design** column, look at the **Prioritization** column and **Hi-fi Design Please** column.

### **Do the work in Figma**

{% hint style="warning" %}
Make sure you are working in the correct iteration page on Figma.
{% endhint %}

It will be noted in the [Onboarding & Introductions](https://www.figma.com/file/v5HdxDsvO2NzMuZU6CArzF/Resilience-App?node-id=1257%3A553) page.

**Note:** _Figma is our source of truth for design. We’re working collaboratively, all over the world and at different times and with different personal processes. If/when you edit a global style or component, take a look to see what else has changed and leave a note in Figma or in Slack to let the team know what’s shifted._ 

### **Have a question?**

Post questions in slack or collect them in Figma. If you get good answers, put them in places in Figma where they will be the most helpful.

### **Approvals for work**

When you have finished a user story, hop over to [\#resilience-app](../) and let everyone know it has been completed and is ready for review.

Check for comments on your design in Figma and also in [\#resilience-app](../) in case you need to make changes.
