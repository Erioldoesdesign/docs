# Process

**Start at the** [**Onboarding & Introductions**](https://www.figma.com/file/v5HdxDsvO2NzMuZU6CArzF/Resilience-App?node-id=1257%3A553) **page on Figma.**

* After you have gotten access to edit on Figma, read through all of the information on the Onboarding & Introductions page.
* Add your name, primary skill set, and timezone to the Introductions frame.
* Next, hop on over to \#resilience-design and read the pinned comments.
* Any questions, please feel free to ask away!

**Grab a Task** in AirTable

* On top left, go to “Stories” tab and switch between **Development** and **Design.**
* Under **Design,** you’ll find a column called **Lo-Fi Design Please.**
* Pick out a task from there, note if it’s for MVP.0, MVP.1, etc. \(As of April 15, 2020, we are working on releasing MVP.0\).
* Slide that story over to the **Design Underway** column**.**
* Once the task is designed in Figma, go back to AirTable and slide that block over to the **Lo-Fi Design Ready** column and make sure to link the frame in Figma in the notes section of the AirTable user story card.
* In the \#resilience-app Slack channel, let everyone know you have finished the design for ‘X’ card,  include a link to the AirTable user story card and the Figma link \(and prototype link if available\).
* If there is nothing to do in the **Lo-Fi Design** column, look at the **Prioritization** column and **Hi-fi Design Please** column.

**Do the Work** in Figma

* Make sure you are working in the correct iteration page on Figma. It will be noted in the Onboarding & Introductions page.
* **Note:** _Figma is our source of truth for design. We’re working collaboratively, all over the world and at different times and with different personal processes. If/when you edit a global style or component, take a look to see what else has changed and leave a note in Figma or in Slack to let the team know what’s shifted._ 

**Questions** about work

* Post questions in slack or collect them in Figma. If you get good answers, put them in places in Figma where they will be the most helpful.

**Approvals** for work

* When you have finished a user story, hop over to \#resilience-app and let everyone know it has been completed and is ready for review.
* Check for comments on your design in Figma and also in \#resilience-app in case you need to make changes.
