# Process

**Grab a Task** in AirTable

* On top left, go to “Stories” tab and switch between **Development** and **Design**
* Under **Design**, you’ll find a column called **UI/UX Design.**
* Pick out a task from there, note if it’s for **skateboard, scooter,** or **bicycle** and assign it to yourself. \(Huh? [Skateboard, Scooter, Bicycle](https://blog.crisp.se/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Making-sense-of-MVP-.jpg)\)
* Once the task is designed in Figma, go back to AirTable and slide that block over to **User Story Creation.**

**Do the Work** in Figma

* Make sure you are working in the correct section of Figma “skateboard, scooter, or bicycle”
* **Note:** Figma is our source of truth for design. We’re working collaboratively, all over the world and at different times and with different personal processes. If/when you edit a global style or component, take a look to see what else has changed and leave a note in Figma or in Slack to let the team know what’s shifted. 

**Questions** about work

* Post questions in slack or collect them in Figma. If you get good answers, put them in places in Figma where they will be the most helpful.

**Approvals** for work

* **Skateboard** and **scooter stages:** Connect with the Collaborators on your task, and if you need more approval than that, throw something in slack.
* **Bicycle** stage: @Linc is the product owner for sign-off.
